## Excercises with the Titanic Dataset

#### Installation

For this exercises we will use Google Colab. As a result, we won't need to install anything locally.

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Once here, go to the GitHub tab and pass the URL of this repository, i.e., https://github.com/dwromero/titanic-excercise/
3. Here, you should be able to see a file called `DataMining_PracticalSession.ipynb`. Open it, and you are ready to go (after uploading the data to Colab).

##### Uploading the data

Unfortunately, Colab does not automatically import the data we need for this exercise, and therefore, we need to do this online. Luckily, this is very easy!

1. Download this repository and extract it locally in your computer.
2. In Colab, go to the `Bestanden` tab (with a folder icon) on the left side of the screen (undernead a key icon). And there select upload.
3. Upload the files within the folder `data` in the extracted repository.

Now, you are ready to go!

#### Checking everything
Please check that everything is working properly before continuing. You should be able to run the first 3 code cells of the Jupyter Notebook without any problems. If you have any issues, please let us know.
